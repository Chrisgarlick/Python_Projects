# My workings for Python Projects

I am farely new to coding, any information to help my coding skills would be extremely beneficial!

Below is a list of projects I am currently working my way through. As I complete projects I will add my code into the repository!

  - Change Calculator - Change_calc.py
  - Guessing Game, Higher or Lower - Guessing_game.py
  - Mean, Median and Mode - Mean_median_mode.py

Thanks you for your time,
Chris
